    "The workflow is as follows:\n",
    "- **Query expansion** adds more information or context regarding the user's task\n",
    "- **Initial code generation** generates plotting code based on the provided context\n",
    "- **Code execution** runs the code in a sandbox\n",
    "  - If the program has errors, it goes to a **debugging** agent, which will refine the code to remove errors and send it back for execution\n",
    "  - If the program does not have errors, it goes to a **vision feedback** agent that will provide feedback on the output plot. This feedback is then used to **refine** the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the refined code is executed and the final output image is generated.\n",

Hence, the input provides a `query` (instruction), `directory_path` (sandbox), `example_id` and `input_path` which are used to reference the training data and create the results folder. The `ground_truth` simply references the ground truth image."
